	<h1>Golf, the Ageless Sport</h1>
	<p><IMG src="tiger.jpg" alt="The famous Tiger Woods fist pump" width="200" height="250"></p>
	<p><B>Many find golf boring because of its simplicity and slow pace of movement. One cannot really argue against those two statements, but those who enjoy the sport find a lot more in the game of golf. I love playing golf because I find it relaxing, although at times stressful, challenging, and extremely rewarding. Golf can be played alone or with friends, competitively or recreationally, and perhaps its best quality is the ability for players of all ages to play golf. Golf can be played throughout one’s entire life, no matter one’s build or athleticism.</B></p>

	<h3>Golf's Increasing Popularity</h3>
<div style="text-align:left">
<p>Golf’s popularity has continued to rise in the recent years; surprisingly, even without the influence of Tiger Woods. Tiger brought major excitement to the sport of golf, which is not always easily achieved. He attracted roaring crowds from all over the world with his incredible shots and signature moves such as his famous fist pump. Unfortunately, his career took a turn for the worst and it severely impacted golf. However, golf is on the rise with the influence of new technology and ease of access to so much information about golf. The internet can be a great place to learn all about golf. In addition to this, the University of Georgia has a fantastic golf course minutes away from campus. Students receive discounts on tee times and range prices, and the course was recently named in the top ten courses for universities in the United States. Get out there and have some fun.</p>
<p>I encourage people to at least try playing the sport of golf, especially because it is a lot more fun playing than to watch on TV. Most would agree that watching golf on TV is pretty boring for the most part. Natural ability may be an advantage in golf, but anyone has the ability to become great at golf; it just takes practice.</p>
